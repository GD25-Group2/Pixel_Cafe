# Changelog

## Prototype Below
### version no. - date
- Changes described such that even outsider can see the progress.

### v0.1.0 - 2026-04-05
- Rough outline of the project is created.

### v0.2.0 - 2026-04-17
- Pixel is font is changed into gFonts table with a variety of font size to accomoadate different writing purpose.
- Changed StateStack's pop and update function so that specific states are exited and also update all the states not just the top one.
- Cursor entity is added with a isDragging property to handle displaying something being dragged. Currently, due to limited assets, only a white cirlce is being dragged.
- Customer State entity now is a functional entity with the capability of redering, receiving order and exiting upon receiving order.
- When entering DayEndState, instead of poping the top of the stack, changed to clearing everything in the stack that includes all the entities and the playstate.
- In playstate, instead of making independent variable like the previous update, make them all global states.
- Change the font of time display.
- In playstate, added dragging logic. Delete the rectangle representing the customer and make it so that there are three customers.
- Data related to entities are written in constants file.
- Move the require of constants below gFonts and gFrames in Dependencies.
- In main file, functions for mouse operations are added. And mx and my are changed from local to global with mouseX and mouseY.
- Added PauseMenu. click p to enter pausemenu and then enter to exit pausemenu. For future use, the state stack is modified to house both play state and pause menu simutaneously.

### v0.3.0 - 2026-04-20
- Extracted time management and tracking logic from PlayState into a new dedicated TimeManager class.
- Stabilized the timer UI by separating the digital clock values from the AM/PM period strings with absolute coordinates to prevent shifting.
- Modified the time UI to only visually update every 15 in-game minutes, making the time cleanly skip steps while maintaining exact continuous time underneath.

### v0.4.0 - 2026-04-21
- In playstate, previous mouse check mechanic is now replaced with a universal one which doesn't need adding more lines. By using interactables table and getInteractableAt function, just adding other interactable entities at the table is all it takes now.
- Separate the condition checking for click and drag so that condition checkings can be reduced further down the line.
- Now all the entities include property type.
- Add a new file to handle basic functions of entities which include initiating a parameter, rendering, mouse check and mouse response.
- Unlike the issue requirement, the circle doesn't disappear with time but drawn. Color is set to a desired color and then reset to white to avoid impacting other entities.
- gColors is built with nine colors to faciliate the use of colors in the future.
- A decision is registered.

### v0.5.0 - 2026-04-22
- **constants.lua**: Replaced static `CUSTOMER_ENTITIES` table with `WAITING_SLOTS` (three x,y counter positions), `ENTRANCE_X`, and `EXIT_X` for linear customer movement. Added `CUSTOMER_CONFIG` (moveSpeed, spawnInterval, patienceMax, patienceDecayRate, baseTip, patienceBonus) and `ORDER_TYPES` table for order pricing.
- **CustomerState.lua**: Full rewrite into a state-driven lifecycle: `MOVING_IN → WAITING → PAYING → LEAVING → DONE`. Customers walk from `ENTRANCE_X` to an assigned slot, wait with an order box, briefly pause in a PAYING state upon receiving their order, then walk to `EXIT_X`. `receiveItem(itemType)` performs a strict string comparison against `self.orderType`. Payment includes a patience-scaled tip.
- **OrderBox.lua**: Created as a separate entity owned by `CustomerState`. Renders a white box with the order label and a colour-coded patience bar (green → yellow → red). Patience decays at `CUSTOMER_CONFIG.patienceDecayRate` per second; hitting 0 triggers `customer:leaveImpatient()`. Box size reduced to 34×26 after initial size was too large.
- **CustomerManager.lua**: New file. Handles the customer spawn timer (with ±0.5 s jitter), slot occupancy tracking, and removal of `done`-state customers. Exposes `getAllCustomers()`, `getOccupiedSlotCount()`, and related helpers to keep `PlayState` clean.
- **FloatingMoney.lua**: New entity. Spawns at the customer's position when an order is paid, floats upward 40 px, and fades out over 1.5 seconds. Managed entirely by `PlayState`'s own table — never pushed to the state stack.
- **PlayState.lua**: Major refactor. Replaced manual three-customer array with `CustomerManager`. All entities (`coffeeMachine`, `cursor`, customers) are now updated and rendered directly by `PlayState` rather than via `gStateStack`, eliminating double-update and double-render bugs. Render order is strictly back-to-front: background → customers → coffee machine (counter occludes customer bottom) → floating money → cursor. Money HUD added (top-right, green). Customer count HUD added (top-left, small font). `deliverCoffee()` and `spawnFloatingMoney()` helpers extracted for clarity.
- **Cursor.lua**: Cursor circle now draws with an explicit amber colour `(0.85, 0.55, 0.1)` and a dark outline, so it is always visible regardless of what the previous render call set. Cursor is rendered as the absolute last draw call in `PlayState:render()`, guaranteeing it appears on top of all other entities including customers and the coffee machine.
- **Dependencies.lua**: Added `require` entries for `CustomerManager`, `OrderBox`, and `FloatingMoney`.

### v0.6.0 - 2026-04-27
- Button enitity is added.
- It needs text, x, y, desired_width, desired_height, action and clickable parameters.
- When hovering, the color of the box will be yellow and for unclickable the color is gray hover or not. By default it is white.
- Moved mouse related logic including the loops in update function and getInteractAt function and getInteractables function in PlayState into BaseState.lua so that all the game states can share it.
- Just by calling self:mouseResponse() in an update function, we can now use it in any and all game states with the requirements being that state having self.interactables property and the button instance is pushed to gStateStack.

### v0.7.0 - 2026-04-30
- **MoneyManager.lua**: Created a new centralized economy entity to handle shop finances. Tracks persistent `totalMoney` and session `todayMoney`. Implements a "count-up" visual animation for the HUD balance. Centralizes payout calculations (base price + patience bonus) with a strict rule where all transactions are rounded to the nearest 5-unit increment.
- **PauseMenu.lua**: Full visual and logic refactor. Implemented as a polished, centered "UI Card" overlay with a semi-transparent dimming effect. Added three functional buttons: Resume (pops state), Restart (re-initializes PlayState), and Quit (returns to StartMenu with red visual tint). Added keyboard shortcuts (ESC/P) for toggling pause. Suspends all PlayState logic (timers, movement) when active.
- **DayEndState.lua**: Redesigned using the centered UI card layout. Correctly displays today's earnings and new total balance without overlapping the "Next Day" button.
- **constants.lua**: Added `MONEY_CONFIG` for economy settings and `UI_CARD` to define shared dimensions and styling for centered menu containers. Adjusted button positions for better layout.
- **PlayState.lua**: Refactored to delegate all financial tracking and HUD rendering to `MoneyManager`. Integrated keyboard-based pausing.
- **CustomerState.lua**: Simplified order fulfillment logic by offloading payment math to the Money entity.
- **Dependencies.lua**: Added registration for the `MoneyManager` class.
- Add DayEndStateCard and PauseMenuCard entities to handle the problem that arises when the buttons are pushed to gStateStack.

### v0.8.0 - 2026-05-03
- In BaseEntity, render function for Cursor heldItem is modified. onPressed function is deleted and directly used it in BaseState.
- BreadBasket, BreadPlate and Sandwich are newly created.
- Cursor can now display its heldItem if they are defined. If not it will describe the heldItem with text.
- In PlayState, deliverItem function's parameter name is changed from customer to target since it now accomodate the logic including other entities not customer.
- BaseState now directly handle which entity get which function activated imported from onPressed function's modified version.
- Five assets including loafOfBread, panOfLoavesOfBread, panOfSlicesOfBread, sandwichPlate and sliceOfBread.

  Giving name: sliceofbread as an bread (we can change that later) in OrderBox.lua 

### v0.9.0 - 2026-05-08
- `Button.lua` has gained enable and disable function. Now clicked function can only be activated if the button is enabled.
- `DayEndStateCard.lua` gets one more parameter when initialized. Display for currentDate to be shown is added.
- `MoneyManager.lua` has only initializing parameters changed.
- `StartMenuBackground.lua`. Noticed that the buttons disappear behind texture of StartMenu if pushed into gStateStack. Added a new file to handle the GUI.
- `TimeManager.lua` also has its parameter changed or added. Added a function for developer to skip to next day easily. After each day reaches its end, the currentDate is saved.
- At `DayEndState.lua`, money data is saved. Immediately after, a new json file is created with the data.
- In `PlayState.lua`, every machine must now be unlocked to be pushed to gStateStack and get played. Add a local find function to reduce repititive codes.
- `StartMenu.lua` gets a new button and has its own background stripped with the background becoming an independent entity.
- `DataManager.lua` is a self-built library and its usage is explained in that file.
- Developer can now skip to a next day using 'd' key in PlayState.

### v0.9.1 - 2026-05-09

- The green square around the Sandwich Plate doesn't disappear so added one more line to taken function.

### v0.10.0 - 2026-05-10
Added 10-picture animation for the coffee machine that shows it working:
- Pictures are loaded from the `assets/CoffeeMachineAnimation/` folder (named CoffeeMachine1.png to CoffeeMachine10.png)
- The animation plays for 5 seconds while the machine is making coffee
- After you take the coffee, it goes back to the first picture
- To change how fast it animates or add more pictures, edit `CoffeeMachine.lua`
- To start on a different picture, change the number in `constants.lua` (like [1] for the first one)

Also set up a reusable animation system for future features:
- Load pictures into a global table (like `gFrames['YourAnimation']`) in `Dependencies.lua`
- In your entity, add `self.animationFrames`, `self.currentFrame`, `self.counter`, and `self.duration`
- Update the frame each second based on time progress (from 1 to total pictures)
- Start animation by resetting to frame 1, stop and reset after duration or when done
- Copy this pattern to animate other things like machines or characters

### v0.17.0 - 2026-05-23
- Add `StockManager.lua`. There might be a lot of bug. I think I occasionally see one but when I try to confirm it
nothing solid came and there might be more I missed.
- If you see bugs while reviewing, edit the `Debug.docx` directly and commit it. Publish an issue about it in issue tab.
- More files than authorized is touched due to data exchange problem between states.

### v0.17.1 - 2026-05-25

- `Signal.lua`: Created a brand new lightweight custom event/signal event framework to handle decoupled communications across various states and entities without hardcoding tight references.
- `QueueShowcase.lua`: Implemented a new UI drawer system for visualizing the customer queue. Added two new arrow assets (expandToLeft.png and expandToRight.png) to gracefully handle horizontal expansion toggles.
- `ReputationBar.lua`: Created a new standalone store ranking and performance tracking entity to render and handle visual feedback for shop metrics.
- `StateStack.lua`: Optimized the engine stack layout structure to support multi-table rendering layers (states, pausedTable, and popupTable), ensuring background gameplay elements stop updating but continue drawing when overlay UI triggers.
- `CustomerState.lua` & `CustomerManager.lua`: Extensively refactored customer lifecycle flows and layout handling to seamlessly hook into the new signal-driven event loop and state tracking features.
- `PlayState.lua`: Fully integrated the QueueShowcase, ReputationBar, and updated core systems directly into the gameplay rendering pipeline layers.
- `DataManager.lua`: Expanded core loading/saving attributes to handle persistent data exchanges required by new shop and state modifications.

### v0.20.0 - 2026-06-02

- `Plate.lua` is the focal point of this update. It replace the functions of existing bread plate, sandwich plate
and possible lettuce sliced plate and so on. It can handle all kinds of functions for them flawlessly. However, it
will be a pain to animate.
- `PlateManager.lua` handles multiple plate entities and level-related mechanic.
- `SandwichPlate.lua` is now replaced.
- `ShopItem.lua` is tweaked to fit into DayStartShop.
- `Stove.lua` acts like `CoffeeMachine.lua`. Its animation is to be a tongue being bitten by its own mouth and being
spat out to be eaten by the customers.
- `TimerManager.lua` has smaller time scale to have longer in game day time.
- `GameStartShopState.lua` has the previous graphics but its architecture and mechanics uses `ShopMenu.lua`.
- `PlayState.lua` init function has lots of codes commented out due to replace entities and some new entities are
added.
- `ShopMenu.lua` can longer be accessed from play state and is considered replaced.
- `GameStartShopStateCard.lua` handles the ui for `GameStartShopState.lua`.
